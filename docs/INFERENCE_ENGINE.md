# Inference Engine

Psionic is only inference-ready when it can honestly serve compute products rather
than just run tensor math.

## Text Generation Requirements

- model load/unload lifecycle
- request execution path
- token streaming or equivalent delivery model
- KV cache lifecycle
- deterministic execution metadata
- runtime-side latency telemetry that keeps Tokio scheduling and async wait
  time separate from backend compute profiling
- backend capability gating
- served capability publication that keeps supported, route-required,
  refusal-required, and unsupported regions explicit together with context and
  latency envelopes

## Current Bounded Lanes

- Generic OpenAI-compatible GGUF serving may expose different runtime truth per
  loaded model inside the same process. Publication must stay model-specific in
  `/health`, `/v1/models`, and response headers.
- `qwen35` is `implemented_early` through a native Psionic CUDA text-generation
  runtime with prompt-projected image and video inputs at the HTTP layer.
- The `qwen35` lane must publish:
  - `backend = cuda`
  - `execution_mode = native`
  - `execution_engine = psionic`
  - `residency_mode = cuda_accelerated`
  - single-request execution posture
  - no scheduler policy claim
- The `qwen35` lane must also publish:
  - `multimodal_projection_mode = prompt_projection_only`
  - accepted projected media = `image`, `video`
  - the derived `qwen35` multimodal projection config from GGUF family facts
- The first `qwen35` lane supports prompt-replay response-state flows on
  `/v1/responses`.
- The first `qwen35` lane supports image and video request projection on
  `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses` without claiming a native image or
  video encoder.
- The first `qwen35` lane must fail closed for structured outputs and tool
  calling.
- The first `qwen35` lane must still fail closed for system-message image and
  video parts to stay aligned with the real template semantics.
- On March 26, 2026, after fixing the qwen35 full-attention gate scratch path,
  restoring the dense `f16` KV cache kernel, and skipping output-head work for
  greedy prompt-prefix replay, the local `qwen3.5:0.8b` benchmark on this host
  measured about `366 tok/s` decode on Psionic versus about `326 tok/s` decode
  on local Ollama for the same one-sentence prompt and `128` token cap.
- The qwen35 lane is now ahead on decode throughput for this host and prompt,
  but it is still not architecture-closed. Greedy prompt replay is faster than
  the earlier pilot, but end-to-end prompt-plus-decode throughput still trails
  Ollama because token embedding gather and the remaining prefix path are still
  less device-native than they should be.

## Embeddings Requirements

- explicit embeddings request/response contract
- deterministic vector shape metadata
- stable model identifier
- capability reporting tied to the served product
- execution receipt fields for outputs and runtime metadata

## KV Cache Requirements

Psionic now has served KV-cache support. The remaining completion bar is not
"whether KV cache exists." The remaining bar is whether the runtime can publish
truthful ownership, residency, reuse, and refusal behavior across host and
device paths.

The architecture must support:

- in-memory KV cache
- paged KV cache
- tiered KV cache
- concurrency-safe session ownership
- device-resident active decode state
- deferred host materialization for persistence, replay, and fallback paths

## Phase 0 Definition

Phase 0 is complete when Psionic can run a deterministic, CPU-backed
`psionic.embeddings` smoke path with truthful capability and receipt surfaces.

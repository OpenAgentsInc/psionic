# Inference Engine

Psionic is only inference-ready when it can honestly serve compute products rather
than just run tensor math.

## Text Generation Requirements

- model load/unload lifecycle
- request execution path
- token streaming or equivalent delivery model
- KV cache lifecycle
- deterministic execution metadata
- runtime-side latency telemetry that keeps Tokio scheduling and async wait
  time separate from backend compute profiling
- backend capability gating
- served capability publication that keeps supported, route-required,
  refusal-required, and unsupported regions explicit together with context and
  latency envelopes

## Current Bounded Lanes

- Generic OpenAI-compatible GGUF serving may expose different runtime truth per
  loaded model inside the same process. Publication must stay model-specific in
  `/health`, `/v1/models`, and response headers.
- `qwen35` is `implemented_early` through a native Psionic CUDA text-generation
  runtime with prompt-projected image and video inputs at the HTTP layer.
- The `qwen35` lane must publish:
  - `backend = cuda`
  - `execution_mode = native`
  - `execution_engine = psionic`
  - `residency_mode = cuda_accelerated`
  - single-request execution posture
  - no scheduler policy claim
- The `qwen35` lane must also publish:
  - `multimodal_projection_mode = prompt_projection_only`
  - accepted projected media = `image`, `video`
  - the derived `qwen35` multimodal projection config from GGUF family facts
- The first `qwen35` lane supports prompt-replay response-state flows on
  `/v1/responses`.
- The first `qwen35` lane supports image and video request projection on
  `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses` without claiming a native image or
  video encoder.
- The first `qwen35` lane must fail closed for structured outputs and tool
  calling.
- The first `qwen35` lane must still fail closed for system-message image and
  video parts to stay aligned with the real template semantics.
- The current `qwen35` CUDA lane is functional but not throughput-closed. On
  March 26, 2026, the local `qwen3.5:0.8b` benchmark on this host measured
  about `85 tok/s` decode on Psionic versus about `321 tok/s` decode on local
  Ollama for the same one-sentence prompt and `128` token cap.
- The remaining qwen35 gap is not admission or prompt rendering. The remaining
  gap is the native runtime itself: hybrid SSM math, full-attention cache
  handling, and buffer reuse are still partially host-driven.

## Embeddings Requirements

- explicit embeddings request/response contract
- deterministic vector shape metadata
- stable model identifier
- capability reporting tied to the served product
- execution receipt fields for outputs and runtime metadata

## KV Cache Requirements

Psionic now has served KV-cache support. The remaining completion bar is not
"whether KV cache exists." The remaining bar is whether the runtime can publish
truthful ownership, residency, reuse, and refusal behavior across host and
device paths.

The architecture must support:

- in-memory KV cache
- paged KV cache
- tiered KV cache
- concurrency-safe session ownership
- device-resident active decode state
- deferred host materialization for persistence, replay, and fallback paths

## Phase 0 Definition

Phase 0 is complete when Psionic can run a deterministic, CPU-backed
`psionic.embeddings` smoke path with truthful capability and receipt surfaces.

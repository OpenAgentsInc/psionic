# Inference Engine

Psionic is only inference-ready when it can honestly serve compute products rather
than just run tensor math.

## Text Generation Requirements

- model load/unload lifecycle
- request execution path
- token streaming or equivalent delivery model
- KV cache lifecycle
- deterministic execution metadata
- runtime-side latency telemetry that keeps Tokio scheduling and async wait
  time separate from backend compute profiling
- backend capability gating
- served capability publication that keeps supported, route-required,
  refusal-required, and unsupported regions explicit together with context and
  latency envelopes

## Embeddings Requirements

- explicit embeddings request/response contract
- deterministic vector shape metadata
- stable model identifier
- capability reporting tied to the served product
- execution receipt fields for outputs and runtime metadata

## KV Cache Requirements

Psionic now has served KV-cache support. The remaining completion bar is not
"whether KV cache exists." The remaining bar is whether the runtime can publish
truthful ownership, residency, reuse, and refusal behavior across host and
device paths.

The architecture must support:

- in-memory KV cache
- paged KV cache
- tiered KV cache
- concurrency-safe session ownership
- device-resident active decode state
- deferred host materialization for persistence, replay, and fallback paths

## Phase 0 Definition

Phase 0 is complete when Psionic can run a deterministic, CPU-backed
`psionic.embeddings` smoke path with truthful capability and receipt surfaces.
